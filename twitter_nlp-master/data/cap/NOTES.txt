These tweets are labeled as follows (3rd to last column_
      1: appear to contain reliable capitalization
      0: don't appear to contain reliable capitalization

In order to determine if a tweet is reasonably capitalized I used the following criteria:
   1. Is anything inappropriate capitalized (e.g. verbs, adjectives, etc...)?
   2. Are any named entities not capitalized?
   3. Are forms of the word "I" not capitalized?
   4. Are words beginning a sentence not capitalized?

Some random notes:
     -URLs, usernames and colins and sometimes quotes '"' seem to function as sentence breaks.
     -Usernames and HTs should be considered as "capitalized"?

The last two columns label tweets as follows:
    -The tweet contains capitalized words which don't begin a sentence, and are not part of an entity
    -The tweet contains entities which are not capitalized
